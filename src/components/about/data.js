  about: `Jimoh is a Nigerian based product designer, UX researcher and writer. He’s worked on a variety in-house brands ranging from small non-profits to successful tech startups with ambitious goals. He has a unique drive at seeing the big picture potential in a product or brand and then bringing it to life.
          More than 3 years of UX, Product Design, and leading creative teams has made me attempt solving design problems. I intentionally built my experience around design and business so I could confidently recommend intuitive, meaningful design experiences to clients - and their customers - across many different industries.
          The results? Happy users and profitable businesses! Jimoh is comfortable working on a range of projects from designing native apps to collaborating with other designers. Whether he’s discusing requirements, illustrating on paper, or crafting prototypes on his laptop, Jimoh always brings a quality of work and creativity that is hard to match.`,
